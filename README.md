# Fluky
An app to randomly generator users. Good for prototyping or just getting some users made up.

## Use
Make sure you have an active data connection, and pull to refresh to generate new users when desired. 
Because of a limitation of the API, the maximum number of random users to generate is 10.

## About
The app had been made in a few hours as I learned my way through using CocoaPods, AFNetworking, and JSON serialization. It proved useful when I needed to randomly generate multiple users while working on some other projects. The code is extremely rough, but it did the job.
