# Fluky

A random user generator app. Useful for when you need multiple random users generated either for prototyping or mockups on the go. 

## Example

## Installation
The application relies on AFNetworking using [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#creating-a-new-xcode-project-with-cocoapods).

```
pod install 'AFNetworking'
```
## About
The app had been made in a few hours as I learned my way through using CocoaPods, AFNetworking, and JSON serialization. It proved useful when I needed to randomly generate multiple users while working on some other projects. The code is rough, and I will clean it up as time permits.
